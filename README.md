## Permissions

If you didn't install nii2png through pip, you may need to grant nii2png.py permission to execute. On unix systems, Python scripts can be made executable using the following process:

```
$ chmod +x nii2png.py
```

Optional: You can also move `nii2png.py` into your bin directory, and it will be runnable from anywhere.


## Python Usage 

1. Let's run the file and start converting images! Please ensure that your output folder ends with a slash to avoid errors.

```
$ python3 nii2png.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfolder>
```

or

```
$ python3 nii2png.py --input <inputfile> --ouput <outputfolder>
```

Tip: You can drag and drop the file/folder into the terminal window instead of typing the path

2. Rotate the images if you wish

```
$ Would you like to rotate the orientation? (y/n) y
$ OK. By 90° 180° or 270°? 90
```

### Example

with change directory command

```
$ cd ~/images/
$ python3 nii2png.py -i brain.nii -o png/
```

with full paths

```
$ python3 /users/ernie/images/nii2png.py -i /users/ernie/images/brain.nii -o /users/ernie/images/png/
```

with long options


```
$ python3 /users/ernie/images/nii2png.py --input /users/ernie/images/brain.nii --output /users/ernie/images/png/
```
